# Air_Passengers_ARIMAX-SARIMAX
This project aims to forecast air passengers using ARIMA and SARIMAX models. These models are popular time series forecasting techniques that can be used to predict future values of a variable based on its past values and other relevant factors.

The project uses the Air Passengers dataset, which is a monthly dataset of air passengers from 1949 to 1960. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the ARIMA and SARIMAX models, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the models.

The project evaluates the performance of the ARIMA and SARIMAX models using the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics. The MAE measures the average difference between the actual and predicted values, while the RMSE measures the standard deviation of the differences between the actual and predicted values.

The results show that the SARIMAX model outperforms the ARIMA model on both MAE and RMSE. The SARIMAX model is able to capture the overall trend of the data and make accurate predictions. However, there are some outliers in the residuals, suggesting that the model could be improved.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use ARIMA and SARIMAX models to forecast air passengers. The SARIMAX model outperforms the ARIMA model on both MAE and RMSE. The project also shows how to evaluate the performance of time series forecasting models using the MAE and RMSE metrics.
